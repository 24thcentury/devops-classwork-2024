Workshop Identifier: devops

Description
In this course you will learn the key principles of Dev-Ops including collaboration, automation, testing, and reproducibility. We will learn common workflows for CI/CD, environment management, package management, containerization, monitoring & logging, and version control. Participants will get hands-on experience with a variety of tools that may include Docker, Github Actions, and APIs.

Please note that this course is not prescriptive around Dev-Ops tools which are constantly growing and changing. Given that, the exact tools that will be used in this course (e.g. Jenkins, Azure Devops, etc) are subject to change.

Course examples will be provided in both R and Python. In addition, some sections and exercises will utilize bash scripting, YAML, and the command line. Participants are encouraged to use the programming language of their choice.
